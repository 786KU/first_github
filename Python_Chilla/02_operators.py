# for combine operators, it work by PEMDAS rule

print (5**2/2*4+5-1/3*2) # e.g., brakets, then power, then divisoin, then mulitiplicaation, 
# then addition, then subtraction, then mulitplication. However, # Also, python executes the 
# operators from left to right for M D & A S

print(5-1/3*2) # e.g., here it divide first then multiply and then subtract
