x=3 # integer variable
print(x)
y="i am learing python" # sting variable

x=10
print(x)
# types/class of variable
type(x)
print(type(x))

# rules to assign a variable
# 1 variable should contain letter, numbers or undescore
# 2 do not start variables with numbers
# 3 spaces are not allowed in variable names
# 4 do not use keywords used in funtions , e.g., mean median, break etc
# 5 short and discriptive name
# 6 variable names are case sensitive, I suggest to use lower case always
