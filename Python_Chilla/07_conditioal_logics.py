# how to ask python about logical operator?
# 4 is equal to 4
# print(4==4)  
# print(4!=4)
# print(10>=5)
# # application of logical operators
# dawood_age=4
# min_age_at_school=5
# print(dawood_age==min_age_at_school)

min_age_at_school=5 
dawood_age=input("how old is dawood") # input function
dawood_age=int(dawood_age)
print(dawood_age==min_age_at_school) #logical operator, keep in mind, it should be integer to execute
