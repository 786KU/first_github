# Lets see how to define a function

# def print_awais(): # name of our function
#     print("we are learning python")
#     print("we are learning python")
#     print("we are learning python")
# print_awais()
# 2 way to define a function
# def print_awais():
#     text="I am a freelancer" # you can change anything to this single line and it will automatically changed to all outputs
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
# print_awais()

# 3 way to define a fucntion
# def print_awais(text):
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
#     print(text)
# #print_awais() #in empty bracket, this will sy missing 1 required positional arguemnt, 
# # so you can add your text here what you like and this would be another way of defining the function
# print_awais(" I am good at python")

# defining a fucntion with if, else, elis statements
# def school_age(age, text):
#     if age==6:
#         print("dawood can travel")
#     elif age >5:
#         print("dawood has grown up")
#     else:
#         print("dawood is cute little baby")
# school_age(7, "dawood")

# defining a function of future
def future(age):
    new_age=age+20
    # print(new_age)
    return new_age
    
f=future(20)
print(f)
